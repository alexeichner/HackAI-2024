# HackAI-2024
Project created for HackAI 2024. We made a full stack web application that
uses a machine learnign model to predict the price of a house based off of 
certain information about the house. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for 
the frontend and Node.js and Python for the backend. More specifically we
used the Sci-kit Learn library to implement the machine learning model. We
used the model on the backend to prevent user information from being easily
accesible by anyone else.

This was the first time either of us have made a full stack web application
and practically the first time we had ever written code in Python. So this 
project was full of opportunities to learn about both web development and 
machine learning. 

In the future we want to be able to flesh out our UI and improve the accuracy 
of our machine learning model through techniques like regularization. 

## How to use the project
1. Install all libraries and packages if not already installed
2. In the terminal execute the server.js file 
3. Open the either of the html files with live server
4. Navigate to form page and submit the form
